										| Patent Timelines
									p.info-section-text.mb-0
										| Easy access to the history of your patent. If you are looking at a patent for the first time or one that you havenâ€™t seen in a while, you can quickly get up to speed.  Patent timelines include key dates (priority, filing, publication, and grant dates) and important events from prosecution (office actions, RCEs, and appeals), and post-issuance events (maintenance fees and expiration date).

Highlight words or phrases with your mouse to create a hotlist of words and phrases that are highlighted in the columns. Useful for both prosecutors and litigators.

									p.info-section-text
